                <li>
                    Which identities are you most comfortable with?<br>
                    Words that describe my identity are man, twenty-three, Caucasian, Georgian, pool player, gamer, reader, dog lover.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Which are the most challenging for you?<br>
                    Being a reader because it can be difficult to dedicate myself to the hobby.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Which of your identities changed or developed over time? How so?<br>
                    Being a reader and pool player are recent hobbies that I have picked up over the last few years. Both of these skills are talents that I have greatly improved since going to college.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Which identities do you share with others in your school or this class? Which are unique to you?<br>
                    I share being a pool player and gamer with other people in class. Being a pool player is a niche hobby that sometimes interests other people, and being a gamer is a way of connecting with others with similar interests.
